### Talk on &ldquo;Opportunities in biomedical data science&rdquo;


These are slides for a short, informal talk that I gave
to summer students in the SROP program at UW-Madison on 13 July 2023,
based on a [talk I gave](https://github.com/kbroman/Talk_Carleton2019)
at [Carleton College](https://www.carleton.edu)
on 1 Oct 2019.
